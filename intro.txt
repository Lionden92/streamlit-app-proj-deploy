A machine learning model was trained on a dataset of iOS apps with data collected 
from App Store listings. A portion of the apps had been involved in data breaches,
while the rest were not. The model learned patterns in the data that distinguish
the two classes, and will produce a prediction on whether or not any given app 
will be involved in a data breach from data it collects from its App Store URL.

It should be noted, the accuracy of the model with data it was not trained on
is such that it will correctly predict a breached app about 68% of the time. So it
is statistically significant, if not highly accurate. That being said, please give
the model a try and enter an app's App Store URL below.
